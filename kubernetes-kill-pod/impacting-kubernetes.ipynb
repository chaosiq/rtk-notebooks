    "To use Kubernetes you will need some tools installed in your environment. To use Kubernetes you will need to install ```kubectl``` this is detailed in the [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). \n",

    "You will also need a Cluster where you can practice your reliability exercises, ideally, you will already have a Cluster running a system that is already well known to you.
